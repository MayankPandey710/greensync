            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Sustainable development in India : Constitutional perspective</h1>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Since the inception of industrialization and the modernization of human society, there has been vast exploitation of natural resources by means of deforestation, mining and animal slaughtering. It was realised at the global level that such exploitation of nature would lead the entire human race towards sheer disaster and not towards development. Thus, the need arose to achieve a balance between human social development and the protection of the ecosystem, which was reiterated at several international forums. The process of balancing human needs and environmental protection was termed “sustainable development.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Background
            </h4>
            <p>In 1968, for the first time, the Swedish delegation proposed to the General Assembly of the United Nations a global conference on the human environment. Accordingly, the United Nations Conference on Human Environment was held in Stockholm (Sweden). The conference was the first major attempt to address issues of environmental protection at the international level. The main objective of the conference was to encourage and provide guidelines for governments and international organisations for the protection of the environment. The conference adopted 26 principles (popularly known as the Stockholm Declaration) as the Magna Carta on Human Development. The first few principles came together as the principles for sustainable development. Even in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (popularly known as the Earth Summit or Rio Summit), various principles were discussed related to sustainable development. Furthermore, in every international attempt to protect the environment, the principles of sustainable development were given utmost importance.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">The concept</h4>
            <p>As per the Brundtland Report (1987), “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Thus, sustainable development demands the protection of natural resources for the next generation and not exploiting everything at once.

              It mainly focuses on three areas:
              
              Economic: By the production of goods and services for development.
              
              Environment: Conservation of natural resources and preservation of biodiversity.
              
              Social: Enhancement of quality of life by proper distribution of wealth and natural resources.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Principles of sustainable development</h4>
            <p>Salient principles that underlie the concept of sustainable development were recognised in the Rio Declaration of 1992 and Agenda 21. They are as follows: 
              1. Inter-generational equity.

              2. Use and conservation of natural resources.
              
              3. Environment protection.
              
              4. The Precautionary Principle.
              
              5. The Polluter Pays Principle.
              
              6. Principal of liability to help and cooperate.
              
              7. Poverty eradication.
              
              8. The Principle of Public Trust.
              
              A developing country like India largely depends on its natural resources for its growth through industrialisation and urbanisation. However, it has also become an obligation for our country to adhere to the international guidelines to achieve a balance between environmental protection and sustainable development. The Constitution of India and the apex judicial body in India, i.e., the Supreme Court of India, have provided guidelines from time to time in this regard.
              
              Let us try to understand the evolution of sustainable development in India from both a constitutional and judicial perspective with the help of landmark case laws.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Sustainable development is a very simple phenomenon to understand, but still a very difficult one to implement. In a country like India, where there is tremendous diversity in every segment of life, it is indeed a challenging task to look after the nation’s growth to cope with international scenarios and to provide a healthy social life to its masses by protecting the environment.

              By studying the directions of the apex court in various cases, we can attempt to understand the complexity of the situation our country is facing while achieving sustainable development. </p>
